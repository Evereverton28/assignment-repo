# Git Assignment – Tic-Tac-Toe Project

This repository was created for my Git and GitHub assignment.  
It demonstrates how to create a repository, add files, commit changes, and push them to GitHub using basic Git commands.

## About the Project
The files included are from a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game I worked on earlier.  
It’s a two-player game that checks for wins, draws, and alternates turns on a 3x3 grid.

## Commands Used
- `git init`  
- `git add .`  
- `git commit -m "1st repo"`  
- `git push`

## Purpose
The goal of this assignment is to show understanding of Git basics and the ability to upload and manage files using GitHub.
